      <h3>Mohammad Abdullah Baboa</h3>
      <p> I haven't had much experience in programming java or 2d visuals
        prior to this bootcamp however I have learned a lot along the way. I am
      most definetely more confident with java and can make some basic projects.
    The bootcamp has been very helpful and the lecturers can explain to you 1 on 1 if
  you cannot solve a problem..</p>

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: MIDI Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
  After attending a lecture based on the sound library for Processsing I wanted to make something
  involving user interaction and sound. So I decided to make a MIDI Piano. I searched online for .wav piano
  note files however it was hard to find good quality ones and I don't have a Piano so I couldn't record my own.
  https://samplefocus.com/collections/grand-piano-single-notes
  This is the website I downloaded the notes from.
  I used the Keypressed, KeyReleased and switch functions to create the visual represnentation of the user pressing the keys.

  The notes on your keyboard would be S-K would be CDEFGAB.

    <h3>Java Project Milestone 3</h3>
    <p>
  This is a game I have created using Java. The controls are arrow keys to move around, space to jumd. You can also use
  S and L to save and load the game at different points. The video game is further explained in the video attached.
